# Detecting Fake News using Binary Classification

#Project Overview

The "Fake News Classification" project focuses on identifying fake news using binary classification techniques. With the growing concern of misinformation, this project leverages machine learning models to classify news articles as "Fake" or "Real," aiding in the fight against deceptive content.

#Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle Fake News Dataset. It includes labeled news articles, with each article classified as either "Fake" or "Real." The text data from this dataset is used for training and evaluating the models.
